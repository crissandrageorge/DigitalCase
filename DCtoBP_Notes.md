# Notes on the DigitalCase to BePress Migration

- Contacted BePress to see if they will help
- contact discovery garden and see if they will help
- deduplication of some records needs to happen
- weird double-indexing occuring on some of the records
- need to have urls with a path to the pdf on a local server to then put into an excel format
